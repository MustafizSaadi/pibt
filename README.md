Simulator of Iterative Multi-agent Path Finding
===
Let multiple agents move smoothly.
See [the project page](https://kei18.github.io/pibt).

## Demo

## Requirement
The visualization relies on [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc).
You need to install openFrameworks beforehand and export `OF_ROOT` of your environment.
```
export OF_ROOT={your openFrameworks directory}
```

The latest implementation relies on [boost](https://www.boost.org/).

## Usage
At first, you must prepare param file.
To confirm details, see [a sample file](sample-param.txt).
Then you can execute the simulator as following.

- implementation with openFrameworks
```
make of
make ofrun param=sample-param.txt
```

- without visualization (for experiment)
```
mkdir log
mkdir changed_log
mkdir changed_changed_log
make c
make crun param=sample-param.txt
```
